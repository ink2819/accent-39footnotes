        <span class="blue" id="f3">    Before.  I were a mountain of cobblestones <br>

            chasing the steel-glazed conveyor.<br>
            
                        Do you know.  clay can be soft. the roads are made of waves. <br>
            
            I and I... lying around for lost flowers. a day has passed. kissing the shoe-sole shape sky<br>
            
                   Before all the before.   a pedestrian was not a pedestrian’s walkway  <br>
            
                       & I was not a stone.  before a destroyed mountain.</span><span class="footnote-marker">[3]</span></p>

        dives as nine floating balls<br>

    <p class="paragraph" id="p8">mother tongue—in two parts: Mother<span class="footnote-marker">[14]</span> and Tongue<span class="footnote-marker">[15]</span>—is the baseline, the ambience, and the substrate<br>

    <p class="paragraph" id="p12">Mothers of mothers of mothers... a fragmented story, with clues that appear and disappear; matrilineal erasure manifests in the letterpress pages, where the inked or uncolored, indented, and uneven characters, along with the spaces between them, tell the tale.<span class="footnote-marker">[19]</span></p>

    <div class="poem" id="p12">
        <p>handmade cloth slipcases<br>

    <p class="paragraph" id="p14">"i" have a carrier bag (the one from Le Guin, you know?). One day, "i" received from Dad a container, the container, and a sequence of more containers—first was the unrecognizable "i" contained in stripes—then in photos—in pencil drawings of the photo and its dated caption lines—in typed texts—in frame...<br>
    each container an eye, each "i"/eye seen through your "i"s.<span class="footnote-marker">[23]</span></p>

    <p>AI needs no chopsticks.<span class="footnote-marker">[26]</span> However, AI is far more fluent than I am in a certain language. I tried several AI tools, comparing them like a savvy shopper, using them as mirrors to reflect the language I struggled with. It just so happens that this language is spoken by the people of my birthplace—my lost mother tongue,<span class="footnote-marker">[27]</span> drifting like scattered clouds.<span class="footnote-marker">[28]</span></p>

    <p>We did it: a machine that speaks our languages. But who's their master now?<span class="footnote-marker">[29]</span><br>
    Who holds all the memories?<br>
    Will memories fade like smoke and ashes? Perhaps they never truly vanish or blur. Maybe they undergo multiple rounds of archiving and categorization. Maybe they are rearranged by skillful hands, adept in the Korean art of floral arrangement (cocoji, 꽃꽃이), into whimsical shapes—an octopus, a piece of cake, lanterns, a nebula…<span class="footnote-marker">[30]</span></p>

    <p class="centered">"Setting"</p>
    <p>a. the gesture of setting a table<br>
    b. the framework element of narration in a story<br>
    Set a window to wear a dress.<br>
    Set to "set" a table, on March 30, which will be full of texts and storylines.<span class="footnote-marker">[31]</span></p>

    <p>In my familiar &amp; forever grey, Sichuanese only uses me for curses.<br>
    Death should not be our learned dialect.<br>
    Streets and streets: my empty mouths.<span class="footnote-marker">[32]</span></p>

    <p>as quiet as night in the day,<span class="footnote-marker">[33]</span><br>
    sing in the dialect of a distant hometown,<br>
    like waving to old friends,<br>
    and casting the shapes of the past and time zones into the void.<span class="footnote-marker">[34]</span></p>

    <p>Beautiful morning wishes are made for you. Contemporary art is gross.<br>
    Not as good as cats' asses. Hearts hearts hearts, Qambarkhan.<br>
    My language is poor, my music is good.<span class="footnote-marker">[35]</span></p>
